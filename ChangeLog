	* Ensured that makefiles can be generated entirely locally
	  (including addition of a copy of makePNEW.perl as
	  scripts/makef95makefile)
	* Updated README to reflect current installation procedure

2006-05-11  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* fixed another bug in sort routine (didn't seem to affect
	results, but was dodgy anyway).

2006-05-10  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* fixed bug in sort routine; more to come...
	* added various facilities to tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	  (but probably needs more work) (still need to add dy_min?)
	
	* Changed some more names (ev_Setdu -> SetDefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Allowed eps to be made an argument of a grid initialisation
	* Introduced query functions for eps and du
	  (DefaultConvolutionEps, DefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Introduced GetGridInfoString(grid,string) to get a 
	  description string for one's run...

	* Changed default global access to be via hoppet_v1 module
	* Changed default Qmax in f77_pdftab to 28TeV (2*LHC rts)
	* Added: src/welcome_message.f90 + introduced "HOPPET" name
	* Added: corresponding mods in convolution.

2006-05-09  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	* swtiched some errors in convolution.f90 (and elsewhere) over to
	the "official" warnings_and_errors handling.

2006-05-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

  	* Implemented deletion of grid_def's + some more name changes
	(notably, pdfset -> pdf in evolution.f90
	
        * implemented direction=-1 for mass thresholds and tested that it
	works properly, using the tests/birectional_mass_thresholds
	program (and running it with various alphas values).

	* more name changes (extra "Delete") + introduced InitEvlnOperator(...)
	
	* switched warnings_and_errors over to a new version.
	
	* changed interfaces in evolution.f90 and pdf_tabulate.f90 so as
	to make nloop an optional argument, with the default number of
	loops being deduced from the running_coupling object; also
	introduced NumberOfLoops(coupling) function for the
	running_coupling, allowing other routines to find out what is
	going on.

  	* changed directory structure (for now), with a new directory
	tests/, while the old testing directory has become testing-other
	(devoted to testing things that are not directly related the
	program development).
	
	* some name changes in evolution.f90 designed to make things more
	uniform wrt rest of program.

2006-05-05  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved some arguments around for the running_coupling type, and
	introduced an optional quark_masses(4:6) argument for setting the
	charm, bottom and top (pole) masses.

	* major name changes related to running coupling handling --
	hopefully it should all become somwhat more logical...

	
2006-05-04  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved holders.f90 -> dglap_holders.f90 (so its name now
	coincides with module name).

	* various name changes in holders.f90 (and global name changes,
	such that gd -> grid and sh -> dh).

2006-05-02  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

   	* some more name changes in dglap_objects; removed limitation in
	MTM convolution on absence of heavy flavour (necessary to allow
	crossing of threshold when evolving downwards, where there is
	almost bound to be some residual heavy-quark piece).

	* one internal name change in convolution.f90 to avoid subsequent
	problems with SetToCommutator.
	
	* merged dglap_objects and dglap_objects hidden (which were
	separated only for support of legacy f90 compilers, hopefully no
	longer in existence). Added SetToZero, SetToConvolution,
	SetToCommutator. 
	
	* removed number of loops from the split_mat type (it wasn't being
	used).

2006-05-01  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * started work on giving consistent names to routines for
	working with splitting functions in dglap_objects.f90
	
        * Moved conv_objects.f90 to dglap_objects.f90, changed 
	  PMat -> split_mat
	  CMat -> coeff_mat
	  MassThresholdMat -> mass_threshold_mat
	  
	* Put some case-insensitivity into the convert.pl script.
	
        * Added version of CopyHumanPdfToEvln etc. where first argument
	is nf (integer) rather than a pdf_rep -- that should makes its use
	a bit more transparent to people. Also switched the rest of the
	code to make use of the new call and removed all prep information
	from sigma_holder. [Tested that answers are unchanged!]
	
	* further name changes throughout

	* added Delete function for sigma_holder
	
        * convolution.f90: fixed various potential memory leaks automatic
	detection of need to allocate grid_conv objects.
	
	* pdf_representation.f90: representation changes now leave decoupled
	heavy flavours unchanged, rather than setting them to zero.

2006-04-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* various name changes to simplify life for the user (mainly
	removal of prefixes which add little information and just make for
	more things to remember)

	* added scripts/convert.pl which carries out most of the name
	changes automatically (sometimes one or two resulting name clashes
	then had to be fixed by hand). Hopefully this script can also be
	used for conversion of existing example programs
	
	* documentation moving forwards. Section 3 on one-flavour problems
	is now at the first draft stage. Should probably next move on to
	section 4 for dealing with flavour problems.

2006-04-28  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* switched sort.f90 to be my own version.
  	* removed unused interpolation routines from interpolation.f90
	
2006-04-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added the example_f90/small_fast_tab.f90 program to examine
	timings and accuracies for a (by default) small tabulation.

	Default parameters give 10^{-4} accuracy at 3 ms/evolution over
	the small region (Rojo's request: 9-e3<x<0.75, Q<50). Timings
	increase to about 8.5ms/evolution for a larger range (1e-6<x,
	Q<14000) and I haven't checked accuracies (NB 6ms with better
	ifort optimization). Note also that eps dependence in integrations
	still needs to be checked.

        Timings below are for small table, with default parameters (see
	svn of this date!), on tycho and gaia (3.4GHz P4).
	
	                          init (s)   evln (ms)     x,Q point (mu s)
	ifort -O                     2.2       3.0               2.8
	ifort -O3 -axP               2.1       2.1               2.6
        lf95 -O                      2.7       2.2               2.2 
        gfortran -O3 -march=i686     5.9     130               180  
	g95 -O3 -march=i686          7.8      21                22            
	
	* increased default interpolation order in the pdf_tabulation to 3
	(2 was definitely too low and 4 might be better). Found that a
	slightly small spacing than used in the f77 routine could be
	beneficial (e.g. 0.07). NB: haven't checked correctness of results
	with -axP on intel (there are reports [banfi] of sporadic
	non-understood problems).
	

2006-04-06  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	Version 1.0
	
	* imported sources from the PDFevln package, with the addition of
	some f77 hooks and the removal of all the main programs; also a
	directory structure has been introduced so that the library source
	in is src/ while the example and testing programs are in separate
	directories.
